If we need to buy something, first of all we go to the shop.
There are many different shops where you can buy whatever you want - from food to screws,
bolts and nuts. It is not difficult to guess what type of store is the most popular.
It may be said without exaggeration that these types of shops are supermarkets
and grocery stores. A human being eats every day, so passing by such shops is a
rather difficult thing.
