I like to spend my time on shopping, preferably I like the self-service shops.
You can scrutinize something as long as you like.
A nagging seller does not hurry you, you are your own master.
After it all, you can calmly go to the cashier, where all purchases will be counted and
 added up. In our time, itâ€™s not only supermarkets that work in such a way,
 but also department stores, clothing shops and household goods shops.
